# Reinforecement Learning
The scope of this project is to test few reinforcement learning algorithms. To do so I tried three apporaches:
* qlearning with mountain_car_v0 environment provided by OpenAI, [mountaincar](/qlearning/mountaincar)
* qlearning with simple environment created on my own, [customenv](/qlearning/customenv)
* deep qlearnig with simple environment created on my own [dqlearning](/dqlearning)
