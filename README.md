# Reinforecement Learning
The scope of this project is to test few reinforcement learning algorithms. To do so I tried three apporaches:
* qlearning with mountain_car_v0 environment provided by OpenAI, [mountaincar](/mountaincar)
* qlearning with simple environment created on my own
* deep qlearnig with simple environment created on my own
